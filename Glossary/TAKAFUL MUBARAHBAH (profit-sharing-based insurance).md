Takaful Mudarahbah
------------------

*Takaful Mudarahbah model* (profit-sharing): the managers (shareholders)
are sharing profit and losses with the policyholders; used initially in
Far East.

According to this principle the *Al-Mudarib* (Takaful operator) accepts
payment of the *Takaful installments* or *Takaful contributions* (premiums,
known as *ra\'s-ul-mal*) from investors or providers of capital or funds
(*Takaful participants*), acting as *sahib-ul-mal*. The contract specifies
how the profits (or surplus) from the operations of the *Takaful* is to be
shared in accordance with the *principle of Al-Mudarahbah* between the
participants (as providers of capital) and the *Takaful operator*. The
sharing of such profit may be in a ratio of 50:50, 60:40, 70:30 and so
forth, as mutually agreed between the contracting parties.

```
"Al-Mudarahbah" is the commercial profit-sharing contract between the
provider or providers of funds for a business venture and the
entrepreneur who actually conducts the business. The operation of a
Takaful may thus be envisaged as the profit-sharing business venture
between the Takaful operator and the individual members of a group of
participants who desire to reciprocally guarantee each other against a
certain loss or damage that may be inflicted upon any one of them.

    and aggression.\"\`\[12\] But does not specifically cite \[Quran

    another in goodness and piety, and do not help one another in sin
    and aggression;\"
