DEBT SUKUK
===========
Sukuk Al-Istisna
----------------

*Istisna* is a contractual agreement for manufacturing goods and commodities,
allowing cash payment in advance and future delivery or a future payment and
future delivery.

A manufacturer or builder agrees to produce or build a well described good
or building at a given price on a given date in the future.

Price can be paid in installments, step by step as agreed between the parties.
*Istisna* can be used for providing the facility of financing the manufacture or
construction of houses, plants, projects, and building of bridges, roads and
highways, etc.

*Sukuk Al-Istisna* are certificates that carry equal value and are issued with
the aim of mobilizing the funds required for producing products that are owned
by the certificate holders.

The issuer of these certificates is the manufacturer (supplier/seller), the
subscribers are the buyers of the intended product, while the funds realized
from subscription are the cost of the product. The certificate holders own
the product and are entitled to the sale price of the certificates or the
sale price of the product sold on the basis of a parallel *Istisna*, if any.

*Istisna Sukuk* are quite useful for financing large infrastructure projects.

The suitability of *Istisna* for financial intermediation is based on the
permissibility for the contractor in *Istisna* to enter into a parallel *Istisna*
contract with a subcontractor. Thus, a financial institution may undertake
the construction of a facility for a deferred price, and sub contract the
actual construction to a specialized firm.

Shari'ah prohibition of Riba precludes the sale of these debt certificates to
a third party at any price other than their face value. Clearly such
certificates, which may be cashed only on maturity, cannot have a secondary
market.

> **Steps:**
> 1.  SPV issues *Sukuk* certificates to raise funds for the project;
> 2.  *Sukuk* issue proceeds are used to pay the contractor/builder to build and
> deliver the future project;
> 3.  Title to assets is transferred to the SPV;
> 4.  Property/project is leased or sold to the end buyer. The end buyer pays
> monthly installments to the SPV;
> 5.  The returns are distributed among the *Sukuk* holders.

> **Precedents:**
> 
> Tabreed's five-year global corporate *Sukuk* (on behalf of the National
> Central Cooling Company, UAE) provided a fixed coupon of 5.50%. It is
> a combination of *Ijara Istisna* and *Ijara Mawsufahfial dhimmah*
> (or forward leasing contracts).
> 
> The issue was launched to raise funds to retire some existing debt, which
> totals around US\$136 million, as well as to finance expansion.
> 
> The *Durrat Sukuk* will finance the reclamation and infrastructure for the
> initial stage of a broader US\$ 1 billion world class residential and
> leisure destination known as \'DurratAl Bahrain\', currently the
> Kingdom of Bahrain\'s largest residential development project.
> 
> The return on the *Sukuk* is 125 basis points over 3 months LIBOR payable
> quarterly, with the *Sukuk* having an overall tenor of 5 years and an
> option for early redemption.
> 
> The proceeds of the issue (cash) will be used by the Issuer to finance the

> 
> As the works carried out under each *Istisna* are completed by the Contractor

> 
> If the *Sukuk* is listed during the *Istisna* period, the *Istisna*
> receivable (amounts held as cash) shall be traded only at par value.
