INSURANCE
=========
Takaful
-------

(Arabic: التكافل‎, sometimes translated as \"solidarity\"
or mutual guarantee) 

is a co-operative system of reimbursement or repayment in case of loss,
organized as an Islamic or Shari'ah compliant alternative to
conventional insurance, which *Takaful* proponents believe contains.

Under *Takaful*, people and companies concerned about hazards make regular
contributions (\"donations\") to be reimbursed or repaid to members in
the event of loss, and managed on their behalf by a *Takaful* operator.

Like other Islamic finance products, *Takaful* is grounded in *Islamic
Muamalat* (commercial and civil acts or dealings branch of Islamic law).

In 2018, the takaful industry had grown to a size of \$27.7 billion of
\"contributions\" (from a 2011 figure of \$12 billion).

The movement has been praised as providing \"superior alternatives\" to
insurance that \"reinvigorate human capital, emphasize personal dignity,
community self-help, and economic self-development\";

but also criticized as having \"dwindled\" in scope to an industry of
\"conventional insurance with Arabic terminology and language of
contract\".

Theoretically, *Takaful* is perceived as cooperative or mutual insurance,
where members contribute a certain sum of money to a common pool.

The purpose of this system is not profits, but to uphold the principle
of \"bear ye one another\'s burden\".

The principles of *Takaful* are as follows:

-   Policyholders cooperate among themselves for their common good;

-   Policyholders\' contributions are considered as donations to the
    fund (pool);

-   Every policyholder pays his subscription to help those who need
    assistance;

-   Losses are divided and liabilities spread according to the community
    pooling system;

-   Uncertainty is eliminated concerning subscription and compensation;

-   It does not derive advantage at the cost of others.

Muslims scholar have \"hardly any difference of opinion\" on \"the need
for managing, redeeming and mitigating general, business and life risks
covered by the insurance business\". But whether conventional insurance
is forbidden (Haram) is disputed.

*Takaful*, sometimes called \"Islamic insurance\", differs from
conventional insurance in that it is based on mutuality so that the risk
is borne by all the insured rather than by the insurance company.

Rather than paying premiums to a company, the insured contribute to a
pooled fund overseen by a manager, and they receive any profits from the
fund\'s investments.

Any surplus in the common pool of accumulated premiums should be
redistributed to the insured. (As with all Islamic finance, funds must
not be invested in haram activities like interest-bearing instruments,
enterprises involved in alcohol or pork.)

Like other Islamic finance operations, the *Takaful* industry has been
praised by some for providing \"superior alternatives\" to conventional
equivalents;

and criticized by others for not being significantly different from them
in its use of the \"law of large numbers\" to spread risk, or its use of
conventional corporate (not mutual) management practices.

The industry was projected to reach \$25 billion in size by the end of
2017.

## Fiqh scholars

In its second session (December 1985), the Fiqh Academy of the
Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (also called the International
Islamic Fiqh Academy) ruled conventional commercial (but not social
insurance) insurance Haram (forbidden). Its ninth resolution stated:

The commercial insurance contract, with a fixed insurance premium, as
practiced by commercial insurance companies, contains substantial
Gharar, which renders the contract defective. Consequently, it is
legally forbidden.

### Argument against conventional insurance:

Islamic scholars began forbidding commercial insurance as early as the
late nineteenth century C.E. Orthodox (i.e. most) Islamic scholars
believe commercial insurance is disallowed for Muslims because it
contains:

-   Al-Gharar (uncertainty);

-   Al-Maisir (gambling);

-   Riba (usury).

They have two main concerns about conventional insurance:

The uncertainty \"if and when the insured event will take place and, if
it does take place, what would be the relationship of compensation to
the insurance premium paid\". (What if the holder of collision insurance
policy never has a motor vehicle accident? they lose and the insurance
company wins. Regarding life insurance, everyone dies, but what if the
death occurs after the first payment of a premium for life insurance?
they win and the insurance company loses.) This \"makes the insurance
business similar to gambling, where the gambler does not know the fate
of the game\". Thus, uncertainty in the conventional insurance business
\"is excessive and borders on prohibited Gharar\".

\"Insurance companies invest surplus funds on the basis of interest and
pay out a part of such earnings to policyholders as bonuses.\" According
to the \'orthodox interpretation\', this is Riba.

### Defense of conventional insurance:

A minority of Islamic scholars argue that insurance is not like gambling
because in gambling, no risk is covered and no damage is mitigated. The
gamblers play a game of chance for entertainment and profit in which
they can win or lose, based on a conscious decision.

Insurance provides coverage for events out of the insured
policyholder\'s control. When the policyholder collects a payout, they
are not a winner, but a loser who at least has some compensation.
Furthermore, while insurance involves uncertainty, \"statistical
techniques and actuarial sciences have progressed to a stage where the
insurance company can calculate its risks and benefits with great
precision,\" so that the uncertainty involved in insurance can scarcely
be called excessive in normal circumstances.

### Scriptural basis

Islamic scholars supporting takaful point to Qur\'an \[Quran 5:2\] and
several sayings (Hadith) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

Some examples are:

**Qur\'an**

Basis of Co-operation: "Help one another in Al-Birr and in Al-Taqwa
(both: virtue, righteousness and piety), but do not help one another in
sin and transgression". (Sūrat al-Māʼidah, Verse 2)\[Quran 5:2\]

**Hadith**

"God will always help his servant for as long as he helps others".
(Narratives by Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal and Imam Abu Daud.)

### Basis of Responsibility:

"The place of relationships and feelings of people with faith, between
each other, is just like the body; when one of its parts is afflicted
with pain, then the rest of the body will be affected". (Narratives by
Imam al-Bukhari and Imam Muslim)

"One true Muslim (Mu'min) and another true Muslim are like a building,
whereby every part in it strengthens the other part". (Narratives by
Imam al-Bukhari and Imam Muslim)

### Basis of Mutual Protection:

"By my life (which is in God\'s power), nobody will enter Paradise if he
does not protect his neighbour who is in distress". (Narrative of Imam
Ahmad bin Hanbal.)

The fundamentals underlying *Takaful* are very similar to co-operative and
mutual principles, to the extent that the co-operative and mutual model
is one that is accepted under Islamic law.

## Takaful industry and models

### History

The concept of *Takaful* has reportedly been practised in various forms
since 622 AD.

Muslim jurists acknowledge that the basis of shared responsibility (in
the system of Aquila as practised between the Muslims of Mecca and
Medina) laid the foundation of mutual insurance.

\"In the case of insurance, as with commercial banks, orthodox opinion
prevailed,\" and with \"a consensus among Muslim scholars\" about the
legitimacy of *Takaful* and the illegitimacy of conventional insurance,
the \"movement for Islamizing the contemporary insurance business\"
started around the mid-1970s. In 1976, a Fatwa was issued by the Higher
Council of Saudi Arabia \"in favor of an Islamic model\" of insurance.

The International Islamic Fiqh Academy, Jeddah of the Organisation of
Islamic Cooperation also approved *Takaful* as a legitimate form of
business in 1985.

The Islamic Insurance Company of Sudan started as the first *Takaful
company* in 1979.

By the mid 1990s, there were seven *Takaful* companies in Sudan, Dubai,
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Jordan.

The industry grew from \$1.384 billion in 2004 to \$5.318 billion in
2008.

By the end of 2011, total *Takaful contributions* amounted to \$12 billion
(as compared to \$4 trillion for conventional insurance).

In 2005, there were 82 companies around the world engaged in *Takaful
business* (77 dedicated *Takaful companies*, and five \"offering *Takaful
products*\" from \"Islamic windows\").

By 2006, there were 133.

As with the traditional forms of insurance, reinsurance of a *Takaful
operation* may be used, known as \"retakaful\".

Also in 2006, AIG, a non-Muslim US-based company (with more than 88
million customers in 130 countries), established a *Takaful subsidiary*
called AIG Takaful Enaya, headquartered in Bahrain.

As of 2013 the leading Takaful countries are \"Malaysia and the Gulf
states\".

It was reported in 2016 that out of total 308 Takaful companies, 93 are
Takaful windows; however, these Takaful windows own only 2.5% of the
total Takaful assets.

## Models

There are several models (and several variations) of how *Takaful* can be
implemented:

**Mudarahbah model (profit-sharing)**: the managers (shareholders) are
sharing profit and losses with the policyhoders; used initially in Far
East.

**Tabarru\'-based**: \"donations\" (Tabarru\'), i.e. premiums, are
accumulated into a fund to meet members\' losses. Members are not
allowed to take back any contributions or profits from investments.

**A combination of Tabarru\' and Mudarahbah**: Bahrain, UAE and Middle East
countries.

**Wakala model**: agency fee, received up front from the contributors and
transferred to shareholders fund.

**Al Waqf-based model**: *Waqf* is a distinct entity and a legal person.
According to one critic, \"except for names and terms, the essence\" of
both *Al Waqf takaful* and conventional insurance is the same, and as a
consequence this structure \"has come under a lot of criticism from
Shari\'ah scholars\". Mainly used in Pakistan and South Africa.

### The Mudarahbah model (profit-sharing)

According to this principle the *Al-Mudarib* (Takaful operator) accepts
payment of the *Takaful installments* or *Takaful contributions* (premiums,
known as *ra\'s-ul-mal*) from investors or providers of capital or funds
(*Takaful participants*), acting as *sahib-ul-mal*. The contract specifies
how the profits (or surplus) from the operations of the *Takaful* is to be
shared in accordance with *the principle of Al-Mudarahbah* between the
participants (as providers of capital) and the *Takaful operator*. The
sharing of such profit may be in a ratio of 50:50, 60:40, 70:30 and so
forth, as mutually agreed between the contracting parties.

In order to eliminate the element of uncertainty in the *Takaful
contract*, the *concept of Tabarru\'* (\"to donate, contribute, or give
away\") is incorporated. Relating to this concept, a participant agrees
to relinquish (as *tabarru\'*) a certain proportion of his *Takaful
installments* (or contributions) that he agrees or undertakes to pay,
should any of his fellow participants suffer a defined loss. This
agreement enables him to fulfill his obligation of mutual help and joint
guarantee.

In essence, *Tabarru\'* enables participants to perform their deeds in
assisting fellow participants who might suffer a loss or damage due to a
catastrophe or disaster. The sharing of profit (or surplus) that may
emerge from the operations of a *Takaful* is made only after the
obligation of assisting the fellow participants has been fulfilled. It
is imperative, therefore, for a *Takaful operator* to maintain adequate
assets of the defined funds under its care whilst striving prudently to
ensure the funds are sufficiently protected against over-exposure.
Therefore, the provision of insurance coverage is in conformity with
Shari'ah based on the Islamic principles of *Al-Takaful* and
*Al-Mudarahbah*.

```
"Al-Mudarahbah" is the commercial profit-sharing contract between the
provider or providers of funds for a business venture and the
entrepreneur who actually conducts the business. The operation of a
Takaful may thus be envisaged as the profit-sharing business venture
between the Takaful operator and the individual members of a group of
participants who desire to reciprocally guarantee each other against a
certain loss or damage that may be inflicted upon any one of them.
```

### Criticism

One complaint made against (most) *Takaful* (by Muhammad Akram Khan) is
that despite the talk of solidarity, (most) *Takaful-holders* \"do not
have any \'voice\'\" in the management of the *Takaful*. The \"TO (*Takaful
operator*) makes all the crucial decisions, such as rate of premium, risk
strategy, asset management and allocation of surpluses and profits\".
The shareholders of the TO, and \"not the *Takaful-holders*, appoint and
dismiss managers of the *Takaful*\". Similarly, Mahmud El-Gamal complains
that \"even companies that use the term Takaful Ta\'āwun (cooperative
mutual guarantee or insurance) are structured with stockholder rather
than policyholder ownership\", despite the 9/2 ruling of the
International Islamic Fiqh Academy that permitted insurance as
\"cooperative insurance, built on the principles of voluntary
contribution (*Tabarru\'*) and mutual cooperation\".

An exception to this state of affairs can be found in Sudan, where the
*Takaful-holders* have more say in the management of the *Takaful business*.
