DEBT SUKUK
==========
Sukuk Al-Marabaha
-----------------

*Murabahah* is basically the sale of goods at a price comprising the
purchase price plus a margin of profit agreed upon by both parties
concerned.

*Sukuk Al-Murabahah* are certificates of equal value issued for the
purpose of financing the purchase of goods through *Murabahah* so that the
certificate holders become owners of the *Murabahah commodity*.

The issuer of the certificate is the seller of the *Murabahah commodity*,
the subscribers are the buyers of that commodity, and the realised funds
are the purchasing cost of the commodity. The certificate holders own
the *Murabahah commodity* and are entitled to its final sale price upon
the re-sale of the Commodity.

The possibility of having legally acceptable *Murabahah-based Sukuk* is
only feasible in the primary market. The negotiability of these *Sukuk* or
their trading at the secondary market is not permitted by Sharia, as the
certificates represent a debt owing from the subsequent buyer of the
Commodity to the certificate-holders and such trading amounts to trading
in debt on a deferred basis, which will result in Riba.

Despite being debt instruments, the *Murabahah Sukuk* could be negotiable
if they are the smaller part of a package or a portfolio, the larger
part of which is constituted of negotiable instruments such as *Mudaraba*,
*Musharaka*, or *Ijarah Sukuk*.

*Murabahah Sukuk* have, however, become popular in Malaysian market due to
a more liberal interpretation of Fiqh by Malaysian jurists permitting
sale of debt (Bai-Al-Dayn) at a negotiated price.
