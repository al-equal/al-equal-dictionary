INSURANCE
=========
Takaful Al-Waqf
---------------

In *Al-Waqf* version of *Takaful*, *Waqf* is a distinct entity and a legal
person. According to one critic, \"except for names and terms, the
essence\" of both *Al Waqf takaful* and conventional insurance is the
same, and as a consequence this structure \"has come under a lot of
criticism from Shari\'ah scholars\". Mainly used in Pakistan and South
Africa.
