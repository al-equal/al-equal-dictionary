INSURANCE
=========
Takaful Tabarru\'
----------------

*Tabarru\'-based Takaful*: \"donations\" (*Tabarru\'*), i.e. premiums, are
accumulated into a fund to meet members\' losses. Members are not
allowed to take back any contributions or profits from investments.

In order to eliminate the element of uncertainty in the *Takaful
contract*, the concept of *Tabarru\'* (\"to donate, contribute, or give
away\") is incorporated. Relating to this concept, a participant agrees
to relinquish (as *tabarru\'*) a certain proportion of his *Takaful
installments* (or contributions) that he agrees or undertakes to pay,
should any of his fellow participants suffer a defined loss. This
agreement enables him to fulfill his obligation of mutual help and joint
guarantee.

In essence, *Tabarru\'* enables participants to perform their deeds in
assisting fellow participants who might suffer a loss or damage due to a
catastrophe or disaster. The sharing of profit (or surplus) that may
emerge from the operations of a *Takaful* is made only after the
obligation of assisting the fellow participants has been fulfilled. It
is imperative, therefore, for a *Takaful operator* to maintain adequate
assets of the defined funds under its care whilst striving prudently to
ensure the funds are sufficiently protected against over-exposure.
Therefore, the provision of insurance coverage is in conformity with
Shari'ah based on the Islamic principles of *Al-Takaful* and
*Al-Mudarahbah*.

A combination of *Tabarru\'* and *Mudarahbah* is widely used in Bahrain, UAE
and Middle East countries.
