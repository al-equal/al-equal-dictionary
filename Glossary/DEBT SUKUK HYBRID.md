==========
Sukuk Hybrid
------------

Considering the fact that *Sukuk* issuance and trading are important means
of investment and taking into account the various demands of investors,
a more diversified Sukuk -hybrid or mixed asset Sukuk -emerged in the
market.

In a *hybrid Sukuk*, the underlying pool of assets can comprise of
*Istisna*, *Murabahah* receivables as well as *Ijara*.

Having a portfolio of assets comprising of different classes allows for
a greater mobilization of funds.

However, as *Murabahah* and *Istisna* contracts cannot be traded on
secondary markets as securitized instruments at least 51 percent of the
pool in a *hybrid Sukuk* must comprise of Sukuk tradable in the market
such as an *Ijara Sukuk*.

Due to the fact the *Murabahah* and *Istisna* receivables are part of the
pool, the return on these certificates can only be a pre-determined
fixed rate of return.

nevertheless represents the potential of new structures and benefits to
the investors.
