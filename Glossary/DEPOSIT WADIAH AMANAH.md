Qard (DEPOSITS)
=============
Wadiah and Amanah]
------------------

*Wadiah* and *Amanah* are two other contracts sometimes used by Islamic
finance institutions for pay-back-on-demand accounts instead of *Qard
al-Hasanah*, are *Wadi\'ah* (literally \"safekeeping\") and *Amanah*
(literally \"trust\").

Sources disagree over the definition of these two contracts.

\"Often the same words are used by different banks and have different
meanings.\"

Sometimes *Wadiah* and *Amanah* are used interchangeably.

Sources differ over whether *Wadiah deposits* are simply guaranteed by the
bank or must be kept unused with 100% reserve, with another contract -
called W*adia Yadd ad Daman* - allowing \"rights of disposal\" to invest
but guaranteeing \"repayment of the whole or part\" of \"current account
deposit\".

Sources also differ over whether banks can use *Amanah accounts* for its
operations - if it \"obtains\" the \"authority\" of depositor - or not.

Sources do agree that the trustee of *Amanah* is not liable for
\"unforeseen mishap\" (Abdullah and Chee), \"resulting from
circumstances beyond its control\", or if there has not been a \"breach
of duty\".

According to at least one report, in practice no examples of 100 per
cent reserve banking are known to exist.

According to Mahmud El-Gamal Classical jurists \"recognized two types of
property possession based on liability risk\": trust and guaranty.

> 1\) With a trust (which result, e.g., from deposits, leases, and
> partnerships), the possessor only responsible for compensating the owner
> for damage to property if the trustee has been negligent or committed a
> transgression.
> 
> 2\) With guaranty the possessor guarantees the property against any
> damage, whether or not the guarantor was negligent or committed a
> transgression.

Classical jurists consider the two possessions mutually exclusive, so if
two different \"considerations\" conflict - one stating the property is
held in trust and another stating in guaranty - \"the possession of
guaranty is deemed stronger and dominant, and rules of guaranty are thus
applied\"
