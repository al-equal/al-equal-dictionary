DEBT SUKUK
==========
Sukuk Al-Salam
--------------
*Salam* is the sale of a specific commodity, well defined in its quality
and quantity which will be delivered to the purchaser on a fixed date in
the future against an advanced full payment of price at spot.

*Sukuk Al-Salam* are certificates of equal value issued for the purpose of
mobilizing *Salam capital* so that the goods to be delivered on the basis
of *Salam* come to the ownership of the certificate holders.

The **issuer of the certificates** is a Seller of the goods of *Salam*, the
**subscribers** are the Buyers of the goods, while the funds realized from
subscription are the purchase price (*Salam Capital*) of the goods. The
holders of *Salam certificates* are the owners of the *Salam goods* and are
entitled to the sale price of the certificates or the sale price of the
*Salam goods* sold through a parallel *Salam*, if any.

*Salam*-based securities may be created and sold by an SPV under which the
funds mobilized from investors are paid as an advance to the company SPV
in return for a promise to deliver a commodity at a future date. SPV can
also appoint an agent to market the promised quantity at the time of
delivery perhaps at a higher price. The difference between the purchase
price and the sale price is the profit to the SPV and hence to the
holders of the *Sukuk*.

All standard Shari'ah requirements that apply to *Salam* also apply to
*Sukuk Al-Salam*, such as, full payment by the buyer at the time of
effecting the sale, standardized nature of underlying asset, clear
enumeration of quantity, quality, date and place of delivery of the
asset and the like.

One of the Shari'ah conditions relating to *Salam*, as well as for
creation of *Sukuk Al-Salam*, is the requirement that the purchased goods
are not re-sold before actual possession at maturity. Such transactions
amount to selling of debt. This constraint renders the *Salam* instrument
illiquid and hence somewhat less attractive to investors. Thus, an
investor will buy a *Salam certificate* if he expects prices of the
underlying commodity to be higher on the maturity date.

> **Steps:**
> 
> 1.  SPV signs an undertaking with an Obligator to source both
>     commodities and buyers. The Obligator contracts to buy, on behalf of
>     the *end-Sukuk holders*, the commodity and then to sell it for the

Sukuk Al-Salam:

Salam is the sale of a specific commodity, well defined in its quality
and quantity which will be delivered to the purchaser on a fixed date in
the future against an advanced full payment of price at spot.

Sukuk Al-Salam are certificates of equal value issued for the
purpose of mobilizing Salam capital so that the goods to be delivered on
the basis of Salam come to the ownership of the certificate holders. The
issuer of the certificates is a Seller of the goods of Salam, the
subscribers are the Buyers of the goods, while the funds realized from
subscription are the purchase price (Salam Capital) of the goods. The
holders of Salam certificates are the owners of the Salam goods and are
entitled to the sale price of the certificates or the sale price of the
Salam goods sold through a parallel Salam, if any.

Salam-based securities may be created and sold by an SPV under which the
funds mobilized from investors are paid as an advance to the company SPV
in return for a promise to deliver a commodity at a future date. SPV can
also appoint an agent to market the promised quantity at the time of
delivery perhaps at a higher price. The difference between the purchase
price and the sale price is the profit to the SPV and hence to the
holders of the Sukuk.
