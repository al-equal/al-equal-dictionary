DEBT SUKUK
==========
Sukuk Al-Ijarah
---------------

*Ijarah* (lease) is a contract according to which a party purchases and
leases out equipment required by the client for a rental fee. The
duration of the rental and the fee are agreed in advance and ownership
of the asset remains with the lessor.

*Sukuk al-Ijarah* are securities representing the ownership of well
defined existing and well known assets, that are tied up to a lease
contract. This means that *Sukuk al-Ijarah* can be traded in the market at
a price determined by market forces.

*Sukuk al-Ijarah* are subject to risks related to the ability of the
Lessee to pay the rental installments. Moreover, these are also subject
to real market risks arising from potential changes in the asset pricing and
in maintenance and insurance costs.

The expected net return on some forms of *Sukuk Al-Ijarah* may not be
completely fixed and determined in advance, since there might be some
maintenance and insurance expenses that are not perfectly determined in
advance.

*Sukuk Al-Ijarah* are completely negotiable and can be traded in the
secondary markets.

*Sukuk Al-Ijarah* will offer a high degree of flexibility from the point
of view of their issuance management and marketability. The central
government, municipalities, and any other asset users, private or
public can issue these Sukuk. Additionally, they can be issued by
financial intermediaries or directly by users of the leased assets.

Sukuk Al-Ijarah holders, as owners, bear full responsibility for what
happens to their property. They are also required to maintain it in such
a manner that the lessee may derive as much usufruct from it as
possible.

> 
> 5.  SPV receives periodic rentals from the Obligator;
> 
> 6.  These are distributed among the investors i.e. the Sukuk holders;
> 
> 7.  At maturity, or on a dissolution event, the SPV sells the assets
>     back to the Obligator at a predetermined value. That value should be
>     equal to any amounts still owed under the terms of the Ijarah Sukuk.
