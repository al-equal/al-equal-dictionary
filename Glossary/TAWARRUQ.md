Asset-Backed Instruments
========================
Tawarruq
--------

Tawarruq (Arabic: التورق; literally "mint silver", \"turn into
silver\", \"monetizatize"; also know as *Bai\' Al-Tawarruq*, *Reverse
Murabaha*, *Commodity Murabaha*).

*Tawarruq* is a financial contractual arrangement in which:

1.  a buyer/borrower purchases a commodity (other than a medium of
    exchange or forbidden in *Riba Al-Fadl* such as gold, silver, wheat,
    barley, salt, etc.) from a seller on a deferred payment basis, and
    thus gets certain value in possession;

2.  the buyer sells the same commodity to a third party on a spot
    payment basis (payment is made on the spot) and gets money from the
    value he got from a seller;

3.  when the buyer secures the cash from the second transaction, the
    buyer pays the original seller the installments or lump sum payment
    he owes (which is cost plus markup, or *Murabaha*) in certain time.

Both transactions involved must be Shari'ah-compliant.

> **Example:**
> 
> A buyer/borrower buys \$10,000 worth of cement on with deferred payment
> for a total amount of \$11,000 to be paid over two years following the
> delivery of the cement, and immediately sells that cement to the third
> party spot buyer for \$10,000 in cash.
> 
> The additional \$1,000 which seller or bank make is considered to be
> profit, but not financial interest, according to the proponents of the
> scheme.

The major motive of the buyer is normally ultimately to borrow the
money.

The buyer often simply authorizes the bank to buy and then sell the
commodity to the third party on his behalf, thus the financial comes
from the bank.

Because the buyer has a contract for a *Murabaha transaction*, and later
the same transaction is reversed, this scenario is called a *Reverse Murabaha*.

For the Western mind, at least at the first glance, is seems to be a
sham deal in principle. That is how, in fact, many of the Islamic
scholars call it.

*Tawarruq* is currently a somewhat controversial product. The IMF states
that \"*Tawarruq* has become controversial among Shari'ah scholars because
of its divergence of its use from the spirit of Islamic finance\".
Because the underlying intention of the commodity purchase is not for
the buyer's use or ownership, certain scholars believe that the
transactions are not Sharia'ah-compliant. Their argument is that the
absence of any real economic activities creates financial interest, i.e.
Riba, which is prohibited in Sharia'ah. Critics also complain that
\"billions of dollars\" of putative commodity-based *Tawarruq
transactions* have evaded the required commodity trades; and many Islamic
scholars have forbidden the practice. Irfan states that Shari'ah boards
of some banks have taken a stand against *Tawarruq* and were \"looking at
\'purer\' forms of funding\" (such as *Mudarabah*).

However, this is not a unanimous position.

Most of the contemporary Islamic jurists consider a *Tawarruq* as not
violating Shari'ah law. Scholars who accept the contractual scheme of
*Tawarruq* as valid note that it is based on two valid legal contracts,
*Murabaha* and *Bai* (sale). But, according to Islamic banker Harris Irfan,
this complication has \"not persuaded the majority of scholars that this
series of transactions is valid in the Shari'ah.\"

Some prominent scholars have tolerated *Commodity Murabaha* \"for the
growth of the \[Islamic finance\] industry\". Faleel Jamaldeen also
states that \"Commodity Murabaha\" contracts are used to fund short-term
liquidity requirements for Islamic interbank transactions.

The compliance depends on particular details of an individual
transaction, and shall be decided on case by case basis. Many Islamic
banks are using the *Tawarrug* scheme deploying their best judgment to
evaluate the compliance of each particular transaction.

To counter the possible violation of the spirit of the *Riba* ban, some
banks have required the complication (and expense) of two additional
commodity brokers in addition to the customer and financier.

Still, because the buying and selling of the commodities in *Tawarruq*
served no functional purpose, banks/financiers are strongly tempted to
forgo it.

The following list summarizes a research paper by Justice (Retd) Mufti
Muhammad Taqi Usmani', which describes his point of view regarding this
mode of financing:
